# Metadata documentation
----

.

## DEFINITION

* This section allows you to describe shortly your dataset.  See [Documentation on Data management](https://libraries.mit.edu/data-management/store/documentation/).


<div class="decal" markdown="1">
### Short name

* Give your dataset a short name that can be seen as either an accession number or a persistent identifier. This name will then be mainly used to identify it and reference the metadata page via a URL. So it is not the main title of the dataset (see full title). Do not use spaces or non-alphanumeric characters. Only letters, numbers and underscores are allowed. The number of characters is limited to 20.


### Full title

* Concise and precise title of your dataset. It is this title that will appear on the data repository (Dataverse and Zenodo) as the main title. Can sometimes use the title of the publication if it is not too long.


### Subject

* The area of the study relevant to the dataset. The list of terms is imposed by Dataverse. Adding, modifying or deleting them may prevent uploading to the repository. See [OECD](https://web-archive.oecd.org/2012-06-15/138575-38235147.pdf) and [European Commission](https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/eu-semantic-interoperability-catalogue/solution/field-science-and-technology-classification/about) about field of science and technology classification.


### Description of the dataset

* A summary describing the purpose, nature and the scope of the dataset. It is the equivalent of the abstract for an article.


### Notes

* You can add a note which will be added in the data repository. Typically, put here the reference to funders who do not have an identifier recognized in international registers. This field will be pushed into the data repository (Dataverse and Zenodo).

.
## STATUS

* This section allows you to define the status of the dataset, associated rights, dates, etc.


<div class="decal" markdown="1">
### Status of the dataset

* Choose a status from 


    *  **Processed** :  Data are available and have been curated. Which means that the data is in a stable and redistributable version as is.

    *  **In progress** :  Some data is available but more is to come. Some are stable but others are not.

    *  **Unprocessed** :  The data is available but not curated. Which means that the data is not yet stable and therefore cannot be distributed as is.

### Access rights to data

* Indicates the status of the data regarding access and dissemination


    *  **Public** :  Either a link to the data is provided as a resource with password-free access (e.g filebrowser) or access to the data is possible to anyone with access to the storage space (locally or remotely via VPN).

    *  **Private** :  Access requiring specific rights (e.g. filebrowser or on storage space).

    *  **Mixte** :  Mix of public and private access

### Language

* A language that the dataset's files is written in


### Life cycle step

* Specifies the event happening over the data life cycle that is considered significant enough to document.  The list of terms is imposed by Dataverse. Adding, modifying or deleting them may prevent uploading to the repository. See [DDI -CV](https://ddialliance.org/Specification/DDI-CV/LifecycleEventType_1.0.html)

### Additional information

* Although it is preferable to put all data documents online via appropriate repositories (e.g. [protocols.io](https://www.protocols.io/) for protocols) or in an electronic laboratory notebook (e.g [eLabFTW](https://www.elabftw.net/)), you can nethertheless add any comments concerning the data which could prove useful in their generation, in their interpretation, in their location, ...

## RESOURCES

* This section allows you to define all the resources you want. <br>- External resources will be specified by a URL with preference for a permanent identifier (e.g. DOI) but also any URL pointing to data whether they comply with the FAIR principle (e.g. [ODAM](https://inrae.github.io/ODAM/)) or not. <br>- Internal resources will be the data files to be uploaded to the data repository at push time. In the latter case the exact name of the file on the storage space must appear in the location field. <br>- Furthermore, in the case of local data management, it would be wise to indicate in which space the data is located if it is not located in the same place as the metadata (e.g. NextCloud, Unit NAS, etc.)


<div class="decal" markdown="1">
### Resource Type

* Choose the type of the resource. Based on [Datacite CV](http://purl.org/datacite/v4.4/ResourceTypeGeneral).


### Media Type

* Choose a media type if applicable. Based on [Datacite CV](https://bioportal.bioontology.org/ontologies/FDC-GDMT/?p=classes&conceptid=http%3A%2F%2Fvocab.fairdatacollective.org%2Fgdmt%2FMIMEType).


### Description

* Provide a concise and accurate description of the resource. Must not exceed 30 characters.


### Location

* Preferably indicate a URL to an external resource accessible to all. But it can also be a password-protected resource (e.g. a disk space on the cloud). This can also be text clearly indicating where the resource is located (internal disk space). Finally, this can be the name of a file deposited on the same disk space as the metadata file, in order to be able to push it in the data repository at the same time as the metadata (see [Publication](https://inrae.github.io/pgd-mmdt/publish/) on the online documentation).
