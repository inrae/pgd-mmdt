All metadata can be defined using a single file (in TSV format, therefore using a spreadsheet). This is a unavoidable step because both input and search interfaces are completely generated from these definition files, defining in this way each of the fields along with their input type and also the associated Controlled Vocabulary (ontology, thesaurus, dictionary, list of fixed terms). The metadata proposed by default was mainly established according to the DDI (Data Documentation Initiative) metadata schema. This schema also largely corresponds to that adopted by the Dataverse software. See the Terminology Definition section.  </p> <p>2 - Entering metadata will be greatly facilitated by the use of dictionaries.   The dictionaries offered by default are: people, funders, data producers, as well as a vocabulary dictionary allowing you to mix ontologies and thesauri from several sources. Each of these dictionaries allows users, by entering a name by autocompletion, to associate information which will then be added when exporting the metadata either to a remote repository, or for harvesting the metadata. Thus this information, once entered into a dictionary, will not need to be re-entered again.  </p> <p>3 - The web interface for entering metadata is entirely built on the basis of definition files.    The metadata are distributed according to the different sections chosen, each constituting a tab (see screenshot). Mandatory fields are marked with a red star and must be documented in order to be able to generate the metadata file. The entry of metadata governed by a controlled vocabulary is done by autocompletion from term lists (dictionary, thesaurus or ontology). We can also define external resources (URL links) relating to documents, publications or other related data. Maggot thus becomes a hub for your datasets connecting different resources, local and external. Once the mandatory fields (at least) and other recommended fields (at best) have been entered, the metadata file can be generated in JSON format.  </p> <p>4 - The file generated in JSON format must be placed in the storage space reserved for this purpose.    The role played by this metadata file can be seen as a README file adapted for machines, but also readable by humans. With an internal structure, it offers coherence and consistency of information that a simple README file with a completely free and therefore unstructured text format does not allow. Furthermore, the central idea is to use the storage space as a local data repository, so that the metadata should go to the data and not the other way around.  </p> <p>5 - A search of the datasets can thus be carried out on the basis of the metadata.    Indeed, all the JSON metadata files are scanned and parsed according to a fixed time interval (30 min) then loaded into a database. This allows you to perform searches based on predefined metadata. The search form, in a compact shape, is almost the same as the entry form (see a screenshot). Depending on the search criteria, a list of data sets is provided, with for each of them a link pointing to the detailed sheet.  </p> <p>6 - The detailed metadata sheet provides all the metadata divided by section.   Unfilled metadata does not appear by default. When a URL can be associated with information (ORCID, Ontology, web site, etc.), you can click on it to go to the corresponding link. Likewise, it is possible to follow the associated link on each of the resources. From this sheet, you can also export the metadata according to different schemata (Dataverse, Zenodo, JSON-LD). See screenshot 1 &amp; screenshot 2.  </p> <p>7 - Finally, once you have decided to publish your metadata with your data, you can choose the repository   that suits you (currently repositories based on Dataverse and Zenodo are supported).  </p> <p></p>"},{"location":"#additional-key-points","title":"Additional key points","text":"<ul> <li><p>Being able to generate descriptive metadata from the start of a project or study without waiting for all the data to be acquired or processed, nor for the moment when one wish to publish data, thus respecting the research data lifecycle as best as possible.

This is also and above all one of the prerequisites for open science.</p> <p>The first step is to promote good data management, while keeping metadata sharing in mind. One of the main concerns has focused on how to \"capture\" descriptive metadata as easily as possible by mobilizing users' vocabulary, then structuring it for 1) transparency and reproducibility, 2) reuse. Regarding the latter point, there is the aim of one day being able to conduct large-scale meta-analyses. This is why metadata is crucial, but not only that.</p>"},{"location":"about_new/#methodology","title":"Methodology","text":"<p>Since the organization of metadata must follow a schema (i.e., indicating which metadata are expected), the one proposed is based on the Dataverse Project used by many scientific institutions (e.g. the French institutional data warehouse, namely Recherche Data Gouv). This is the default schema that we recommend using. It is nevertheless possible to adapt it.</p> <p>Concerning semantics, we recommend a gradual approach towards the adoption of standardized controlled vocabularies. For example, a simple dictionary of business vocabulary used by the community in the scientific field concerned may be perfectly sufficient. Subsequently, the creation of a thesaurus with or without correspondence with existing ontologies can be considered or, better still, enriching existing ones (e.g., Thesaurus-INRAE). Obviously, when they exist, the ontologies of the domain can be chosen progressively by selecting those which are relevant for the collective and by drawing up a comprehensible landscape of the context in which they are included.</p> <p>The metadata thus produced are used to feed a local data warehouse intended to be subsequently consulted by all the people in the collective. Hence the importance of both the metadata schema and the vocabulary repositories specific to each collective. But these same metadata can also feed other warehouses, e.g. Recherche Data Gouv and Zenodo. Similarly, these metadata must be able to be harvested in order to carry out meta-analyses. It is therefore necessary to set up gateways between the different formats.</p>"},{"location":"about_new/#tools-and-technologies","title":"Tools and technologies","text":"<p>There are three main classes of vocabularies: thesauri, ontologies, and non-hierarchical vocabularies in the form of a simple list.

While a SKOSMOS-type portal is dedicated only to thesauri, OntoPortal-type portals can host both thesauri and ontologies. Support for all these portals thus allows for a wide variety of vocabularies.</p> <p>Other additional but useful resources are also used (via their API) in order to minimize entries and therefore identification errors, but also to avoid duplicates. Examples include the international register of institutions (Research Organization Registry), or the register of persistent identifications for people (ORCID).</p> <p>Regarding metadata harvesting, which consists of collecting metadata via an API in order to store it on another platform, the choice fell on the standard OAI-PMH protocol (Open Archives Initiative - Protocol for Metadata Harvesting]) based on the DublinCore metadata schema.

It is therefore urgent to develop a culture of metadata sharing.</p> <p>Furthermore, in response to the time dedicated to this task, tools that simplify data entry as much as possible are needed. For example, it is easier to select a term from a drop-down list based on professional vocabulary than to choose from a multitude of ontologies. It is therefore not surprising that the greatest difficulty encountered by the various sites was undoubtedly the choice of a controlled vocabulary repository. Indeed, it is common for one not to be able to find all the desired terms to describe a metadata item within a thesaurus, an ontology, or even a set of ontologies. In particular, many business vocabularies are absent from these repositories. The solution in these cases consists of creating a dictionary grouping all the desired terms by mixing those from one or more ontologies, those from thesauri, as well as the business vocabularies. This constitutes a sort of new mini-thesaurus. Therefore, a data manager is required who, upstream, does this compilation work and thus constitutes a controlled vocabulary repository, evolving over time, as part of a process of continuous improvement.</p> <p>Enabling producers to obtain metadata that better respects the FAIR principles, without them always being fully aware of this, was also one of the objectives, achieved by distributing the concerns between the different actors (data managers, data producers, data curators) according to their skills and responsibilities.</p>"},{"location":"about_new/#perspectives","title":"Perspectives","text":"<p>Since the \"capture\" of metadata is crucial, it should ideally be done uniquely and at the most relevant stage of the data lifecycle for each of them (e.g., the name of a project at the time of its submission to funders).

This is why it is necessary to reinforce the tendency to interconnect the different online resources within an information flow following a logic of stages. The description of the project, the participants, with general keywords (ANR type resources), then comes the data management plan (DMP) where we describe the types of data, the licenses, etc. (e.g., DMP Opidor) then the descriptive metadata specific to each project (e.g., Maggot), and finally the structural metadata of each dataset (e.g., ODAM), until the final dissemination (e.g., Dataverse).

The presence of this file within a directory is enough to block access to metadata and data by default. It should be noted that we can put this same file containing the encrypted private key in several data directories (included within the same project for example). The deposit must be done by hand because the Maggot tool must only have access to the storage space in read mode.

However, some approaches require a little technicality by writing small scripts based on JavaScript, but nothing too serious. You can always take an already ready-made script and modify only the part that concerns your focus.</li> </ul> <p>1 -  Vocabulary based on a list of terms fixed in advance (checbox with feature open=0)</p> <ul> <li>List of well-chosen and limited Control Vocabulary e.g according to a reference e.g. Data Document Initiative.</li> </ul> <p></p> <p>2 - Vocabulary open for addition (checkbox with feature open=1)</p> <ul> <li>allows you to collect the desired Control Vocabulary (CV) from users. In order to initiate the list, you can put some terms in the predefined terms column of the terminology definition file.</li> </ul> <p></p> <p>3 - JavaScript-based vocabulary in a text field (textbox)</p> <ul> <li> <p>The JavaScript here involves populating a list variable (e.g. cities = [ ... ]) with the desired vocabulary. The name of this variable must be the same as the name of the JavaScript file and must present under web/js/autocomplete (e.g. cities.js)</p> </li> <li> <p>The list can be directly embedded in the code (e.g. lifecycle.js) or retrieved via web API. For example, to enter a French city you can use the API geo.api.gouv.fr. See cities.js</p> </li> </ul> <p></p> <p>4 - Vocabulary based on a dictionary with multiple selection (multiselect) </p> <ul> <li>Dictionaries allow you to record multiple information necessary to define an entity, such as the names of people or even the funders. These information, once entered and saved in a file called a dictionary. Based on a very simple JavaScript retrieving the complete list of items included in the dictionary, thus creating a sort of internal API, we can fill a Maggot field by  autocompletion related to a search for these items.</li> <li>The JavaScript file must be named dico.js and be present under web/cvlist/dico/ where dico is the name of the dictionary. See for instance people.js</li> </ul> <p></p> <p>5 - Multi-select vocabulary, based on an API managed by Twitter's Typeahead library. (multiselect) </p> <ul> <li> <p>Maggot embeds Twitter's Typeahead library making it relatively easy for a data manager to implement a new vocabulary from its web API. With the help of this library, this allows users to select a term from a list of vocabulary terms within a drop-down list. The list of terms has been pre-selected based on the first letters entered in the \u201cSearch for value\u201d box. This list is dynamically refreshed when letters are added or modified. So, unlike a single call to the API returning the entire list of terms in memory, which can take a very long time to load, the calls are made dynamically on the basis of a portion of a word (3 letters minimum by default), limiting the number of terms to retrieve. Thus this makes use very fluid.</p> </li> <li> <p>To implement an API-based web service, it is necessary to create two scripts (&lt;ws&gt;_typeahead.js and &lt;wstype&gt;.inc) which will each be used at one stage of the process as shown in the following figure:</p> </li> </ul> <ol> <li> <p>&lt;ws&gt;_typeahead.js : This file corresponds to the API call when entering vocabulary using Twitter's Typeahead library. The prefix &lt;ws&gt; standing for web service, must be positioned so as to correspond to the name of the service indicated in the CVname column of the mapping file (see mapping) as well as to the corresponding value for the 'ws' attribute in the column 'features' of the terminology definition file (see definitions). This file must then be placed under the web/js/autocomplete directory. You will find a template file in this directory.</p> </li> <li> <p>&lt;wstype&gt;.inc : This file corresponds to the API call while metadata crosswalks processus and based on the mapping file (web/conf/mapping.txt).The prefix &lt;wstype&gt; standing for web service type, must be positioned so as to correspond to the type of the service indicated in the CVtype column of the mapping file. This file must then be placed under the web/inc/mapping/ directory. You will find a template file in this directory.</p> </li> </ol> <p></p> <ul> <li>By defaut, Maggot already provides some vocaburay web services implemented in this way such as the ontology portals based on OntoPortal, the SKOSMOS thesauri and the EMBL-EBI Ontology Lookup Service. The figure below shows the configuration in the terminology definition file and the corresponding screenshots for each vocabulary.</li> </ul> <ol> <li> <p>AgroPortal and BioPortal are both based on OntoPortal which is a generic technology to build ontology repositories or semantic artefact catalogues.</p> </li> <li> <p>SKOSMOS is a web tool facilitating the posting of controlled vocabulary online in the form of a thesaurus according to the SKOS data model. It offers a navigation interface as well as a web API.</p> </li> <li> <p>EMBL-EBI Ontology Lookup Service is a repository for biomedical ontologies that aims to provide a single point of access to the latest ontology versions.
